# DX-Game-Loader
This is a loader for the various DX games based off the Xbox 360 Kiosk Disc 1.0.
Put your extracted DX game copies in the "demos" folder. You can find the DX mods here https://github.com/hmxmilohax

# Editing Info


Game info is in "gamedb.ini", certain kiosk info like genres is in the "kiosk.ini" and extra textures can be located in Extras/kioskmainextract which need to be repackaged into .xzp archives using "XZP Tool 2"

The language packs are the text for extra languages which havent been translated yet, they will be moved back into the game directory when finished.

Videos need to be defined and added as the original folder was 2.7GB.
